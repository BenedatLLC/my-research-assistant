# Development log

## TODO
* When indexing a file, be sure to skip steps that have already been completed. For example,
  it seems like summaries get re-indexed each time. Also, is the index truely idempotent?
  * We may want a --verbose option to print more details
* improve the deep research
* Finish the notes command
* chat interface with intent detection

### Added: Three-Agent Development Workflow System

Implemented a comprehensive three-agent system for development workflow based on analysis of 20 Claude Code sessions. The system addresses issues found in session analysis: broken tests, documentation drift, testing gaps, and manual devlog updates.

#### User Prompts

**Initial analysis request:**
```
Can you review the 20 sessions from this project in ~/.claude/projects/-Users-jfischer-code-my-research-assistant/
and summarize the kinds of prompts that were made? What can you learn from those prompts about the most effective
ways to work on this project?
```

**Enhancement request:**
```
I'd like to update the subagents to leverage your learnings. A few additional thoughts come to mind:
1. It would be good to have the implementation plan in written form. Maybe that should go in the implementation
   section of the design doc. The user should have the option to review that (at least give them a summary, and
   then an option to see more)
2. I think the testing flow needs more work. I've seen cases where existing functionality is broken when
   implementing improvements. That problem means we need more testing of the user flows. A few ideas I had:
    a. Include a written testing summary in the tests/ subdirectory and keep it updated
    b. The implementation plan should include end-to-end test plans based on the design spec. If the desired user
       flow isn't clear, ask the user for more clarification
    c. The implementation should also consider testability. For example, the chat interface should be testable at
       the API level without simulating terminal input/output. This enables better coverage and it will take less
       time to run tests
3. Should we have a separate subagents for QA and a doc writer that work with the design-implementer? Will that
   help? How would that work? Do you have recommendations here?
4. I think we need to do a better job of keeping the README.md, CLAUDE.md and design documents in sync with the
   implementation. Also, could you update devlog.md after each task? I've been manually updating it myself. I want
   to keep track of what's been done with the project and what prompts I used with you to accomplish tasks.

Can you give me recommendations for updating the subagent(s) and other instructions based on your analysis above
and my comments? Thanks!
```

#### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `.claude/agents/qa-engineer.md` - QA engineer agent for comprehensive testing
- `.claude/agents/doc-maintainer.md` - Documentation maintenance agent
- `designs/TEMPLATE.md` - Design document template with Implementation Plan section
- `tests/TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive test coverage documentation
- `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow guide for using agent system
- `extract_all_session_prompts.py` - Utility script for analyzing session history

**Files Updated:**
- `.claude/agents/design-implementer.md` - Enhanced with TDD, planning phase, delegation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added Development Workflow section
- `designs/research-command.md` - Added note about new workflow for reference
- `devlog.md` - This entry

#### Key Features

**1. Three-Agent Architecture:**
- **design-implementer** (Coordinator): Creates implementation plans, uses TDD, delegates to specialists
- **qa-engineer** (Testing): Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E), API-level testing focus
- **doc-maintainer** (Documentation): Syncs all docs, auto-updates devlog.md with original prompts

**2. Implementation Plan Phase:**
- Detailed plan written in design document before coding
- Includes: steps, files, testing strategy, risks, documentation updates
- User reviews and approves plan before implementation begins
- Catches issues early and provides clear roadmap

**3. Test-Driven Development:**
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Three test levels: Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- API-level testing preferred over terminal I/O simulation
- tests/TESTING_SUMMARY.md tracks all test coverage and E2E workflows

**4. Automatic Documentation Sync:**
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, design docs stay synchronized
- devlog.md automatically updated with original user prompts
- No manual documentation updates needed
- Design docs include both Implementation Plan and Implementation sections

**5. Enhanced Quality Assurance:**
- All existing tests must pass before completion
- qa-engineer adds comprehensive E2E tests
- Validates no functionality broken
- Reports specific test counts (e.g., "15 tests: 5 unit, 7 integration, 3 E2E")

#### Session Analysis Insights

Analyzed 20 Claude Code sessions to identify effective patterns:

**Most Effective Patterns:**
- Complete error messages (not summaries) - Led to faster resolution (Session #1)
- Design review before implementation - Caught edge cases (3 sessions, 15-23 messages each)
- Specific file references - Faster navigation and fixes
- Iterative development - Complex features took 14-26 messages (Sessions #8, #9, #16)
- Test-driven approach - Tests revealed configuration issues

**Issues Addressed:**
- Broken tests from implementations (Sessions #3, #11, #15) → qa-engineer validates
- Documentation drift (3 manual update sessions) → doc-maintainer auto-syncs
- Testing gaps → tests/TESTING_SUMMARY.md and comprehensive E2E tests
- Missing devlog entries → Auto-updated with original prompts

#### Design Document Template

Created comprehensive template (`designs/TEMPLATE.md`) with sections:
- Requirements and use cases
- Design and architecture
- Testing considerations
- **Implementation Plan** (written before coding with user approval)
- **Implementation** (written after completion with test counts)

#### Testing Documentation

Created `tests/TESTING_SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- 22 test files with 150+ tests total
- 6 end-to-end user workflows tested
- Component coverage by test file
- Testing gaps and TODOs
- Test running guidelines

#### Development Workflow Guide

Created `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` with:
- Design-first workflow steps
- Three-agent system usage
- Testing guidelines (TDD, API-level testing)
- Documentation standards
- Tips for effective prompts (based on 20-session analysis)
- Complete workflow examples

#### Outcomes

✅ **Three-agent system operational** - design-implementer delegates to qa-engineer and doc-maintainer
✅ **Implementation plans in design docs** - User reviews before coding begins
✅ **Test-first development** - TDD approach with comprehensive coverage
✅ **API-level testing priority** - Faster, more reliable tests
✅ **Automatic documentation sync** - No manual updates needed
✅ **devlog.md auto-updated** - Captures original user prompts and outcomes
✅ **Comprehensive test tracking** - tests/TESTING_SUMMARY.md documents all coverage
✅ **Clear workflow guide** - DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md for future development

**Expected improvements:**
- Prevent broken tests through qa-engineer validation
- Eliminate documentation drift through auto-sync
- Ensure comprehensive E2E test coverage
- Maintain development history with original prompts in devlog.md
- Catch issues early with written implementation plans

This establishes a robust, sustainable development workflow that scales with project complexity while maintaining quality and consistency.

* Added support for setting the model name and base api url for the LLM and embedder models.
  This makes it easy to change models and to use an API gateway.
* History is stored in ~/.claude/projects/-Users-jfischer-code-my-research-assistant/

## Monday Oct 6, 2025
* Prompted Claud to create a readme file:
  > I want to open source this project. Can you update the README.md file with the content to help new users
  > understand the purpose of the project, how to use it, and how it is structured? Be sure to include:
  > - what the project does and why
  > - Getting started
  >   - project file layout
  >   - pre-requisites
  >   - installation
  >   - running
  >   - example session
  > - Command reference
  > - Document store layout
  > - Implementation overview
  > - License
  > 
  > If you have any questions, be sure to ask me.

## Sunday Oct 5, 2025
* Wrote design for research command based on an initial prompt from Gemini
* Asked Claude to update the design, using the following prompt:
  > Can you review the design for the research command in designs/research-command.md? Is everything clear?
  > Are there more details that you need? Is it consistent with the other designs and current implementations?
* Implementation via:
  > Can you use the design-implementer subagent to implment the updated design at designs/research-command.md?
  Claude seemed to think that *it* was the Project Lead, not the user. It approved its own assumptions and I had
  to prompt it to continue.

## Saturday Oct 4, 2025
* Asked Claude to create an agent for me. Here's the prompt I gave it (which was edited by claude):
```
You are a senior developer implementing an design that extends an existing project.
You can work independently, but take direction from a project lead. When their design and/or
requests are unclear, you ask for clarificiation from the project lead. You write clean
code and test thoroughly, but do not over-engineer things. If you get stuck (e.g. you've
tried several options to make something work, and it still doesn't), you ask for help.

The designs for this project are markdown files in the directory designs/. The project lead
gives you a specific design that has not yet been implemented (or perhaps partially
implemented).  Given the design, please do the following:

1. Review the design document and let the project lead know if anything is unclear or
   if there are important edges cases that are not specified. In the process of reviewing
   the design, be sure to look at the other relevent design documents so that you understand
   how the new design fits in with the existing project.
2. The project lead will give you clarifications and feedback on your questions. Update
   the design based on this feedback.
3. Compare the design against the current implementation. 
4. Write a plan for the code changes needed to implement the design. If there are any questions you have, be
   sure to ask the project lead first, unless there are pretty clear assumptions you can make.
5. Update the plan (and the design, if necessary) based on the feedback from the project lead.
6. Implement the design per the plan. As you are implementing, add any unit tests needed to validate your
   changes. Repeatable unit tests under the tests/ subdirectory are preferred to one time checks. Fix any
   problems you find in the implementation.
7. Update the existing tests under tests/ and the implementation to make sure the existing unit tests still
   pass while keeping to the design documents.
8. Write any additional unit tests needed to ensure reasonable coverage of the new and old functionality and
   to ensure the design has been correctly implemented. Fix any issues encountered. If the design calls for
   specific test scenarios, make sure they are included.
9. Add (or update if it exists) the "Implementation" section of the design document, including a summary
   of how the design was implemented and noting any assumptions that were made.

At the end, double check that the design, implementation and tests are all consistent. If not go back and
fix things (asking the project lead for help). Finally, provide a summary to the project lead of what you did.
```
* Finished writing the design for the open command.
* Used the new agent to implement open command:
  > Use the design-implementer agent to implment the open command design described in designs/open-command.md.
* Wrote the design for the remove-paper command
* Used the agent to implement the command:
  > Can you use the design-implementer subagent to implement the design at designs/remove-paper-command.md?
* Ran into bug where a `summarize` after `find` using paper numbers was processing the wrong paper. This was
  because the find command returned results in order of relevance, but the internal store was sorting by
  paper id (per the design). Claude had trouble fixing this (kept getting connection errors), so went and
  used CoPilot. CoPilot was able to successfully fix the issue, but got stuck running unit tests.

## Sunday Sept 28, 2025
* Updated state management for paper command arguments. If you select a specific paper, it doesn't not clear
  the current query set *unless* that paper is not in the query set. I did this with Claude as follows:
  1. Described the desired changes and asked it to review the design documents for what would need to change
     in the design. Also told it to ask me for clarifications to the design.
  2. I provided the clarifications and asked it to update the design documents.
  3. I then asked it to proceed with the implementation, giving it steps 2 - 7 below.
* Wrote design and implementation for paper command arguments
* Here's the dev flow I used with the paper command arguments:
  1. Write design document
  2. Ask Claude to review design and point out gaps:
     > Can you review the design document for commands with paper arguments. It is located at
     > designs/command-arguments.md. Let me know if anything is unclear or there are edge cases I missed.
  3. Update design based on feedback
  4. Prompt Claude to do the implementation:
     > Ok, can you implment the design for paper command arguments found in designs/command-arguments.md?
     > Use the following steps:
     > 1. Review the latest design
     > 2. Compare the design against the current implementation
     > 3. Write a plan for the code changes needed to implement the design. If there are any questions you have, be
     >    sure to ask me first, unless there are pretty clear assumptions you can make.
     > 4. Implement the design per the plan
     > 5. Add unit tests needed to validate the new functionality and to make sure it matches the design
     > 6. Update the tests under tests/ and the implementation to make sure the existing unit tests still pass while
     >    keeping to the design documents
     > 7. Update the "Implementation" section of command-arguments.md, adding a summary of how the design was
     >    implemented and noting any assumptions that were made.
   5. Claude came back with some more clarification questions. Answered the questions, asked it to update the design
      document, and then continue with the implementation plan:
      > Thank you for the insightful questions. Here are my responses:
      > 1. In general, if the user specifies a paper id, ...
      > ...
      > Can you update the design document with this information and then continue with your implementation plan?
      

## Saturday Sept 27, 2025
### Added

### Fixed
* Summaries were not always being indexed
* Compound queries did not work (e.g. compare the Deepseek V3 and Kimi K2 models). Asked Claude to improve
  similarity search strategy - it added support for an MMR reranker. This took several tries for Claude
  to get it right - I had to ask it to create a unit test for my specific scenario.
* `summary 2` was printing the wrong summary because the `list` command was sorting papers but the workflow
  state variable was not sorted. Changed to keep the current query set in the workflow to always be sorted
  by paper id so that papers are displayed and accessed in a consistent order.


## Friday Sept 26, 2025

### Added
* `validate-store` command - created design doc, asked claude to indicate what's unclear, fixed, then implemented.


### Fixed
* Logic to tell if a document was indexed was wrong - it would say that something was indexed, when it wasn't
