## Design

### Architecture

Describe how this feature fits into the existing architecture:
- Which components/modules are affected?
- How does data flow through the system?
- What are the key interfaces/APIs?

You can use ASCII diagrams if helpful:
```
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│  Component A │──────>│  Component B │──────>│  Component C │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

### State Management (if applicable)

- What state changes occur?
- How does this interact with the existing state machine?
- What state variables are needed?

### Data Structures (if applicable)

Describe any new data structures or modifications to existing ones:

```python
class NewDataStructure:
    field1: str
    field2: int
    field3: Optional[List[str]]
```

### User Interface (if applicable)

- What commands are added/modified?
- What is the command syntax?
- What output does the user see?
- How are errors communicated?

Example:
```
> new-command <arg1> [optional-arg2]

Processing...
✓ Success message
Results displayed here
```

### Error Handling

- What can go wrong?
- How should errors be handled?
- What error messages should users see?

### Edge Cases

- What are the boundary conditions?
- How should the system handle unusual inputs?
- What happens in error scenarios?

## Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1**: [Happy path]
   - Given: ...
   - When: ...
   - Then: ...

2. **Scenario 2**: [Error case]
   - Given: ...
   - When: ...
   - Then: ...

3. **Scenario 3**: [Edge case]
   - Given: ...
   - When: ...
   - Then: ...

### End-to-End User Flows

Complete workflows that should be tested:

1. **Flow**: Find → Select → Process
   - Step 1: User runs `command1 arg`
   - Step 2: System shows results
   - Step 3: User runs `command2 number`
   - Step 4: System processes and displays output

## Dependencies

- What existing components does this depend on?
- Are there any external dependencies?
- Are there any ordering constraints with other features?

## Alternatives Considered

What other approaches were considered and why were they not chosen?

- **Alternative 1**: ...
  - Pros: ...
  - Cons: ...
  - Decision: Not chosen because...

## Open Questions

- [ ] Question 1: ...
- [ ] Question 2: ...
- [ ] Question 3: ...

## Implementation Plan

_This section is added by design-implementer during Phase 2, before coding begins._

### Summary

High-level overview of the implementation approach.

### Files to Create/Modify

- `src/module1.py` - Add new function X, modify function Y
- `src/module2.py` - Create new class Z
- `tests/test_module1.py` - Add unit tests for X and Y
- `tests/test_module2.py` - Create new test file for Z
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Add E2E tests for user workflow

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Step 1**: Create data structures
   - Add NewClass to module1.py
   - Update existing DataClass with new field

2. **Step 2**: Implement core logic
   - Add process_data() function
   - Integrate with existing workflow

3. **Step 3**: Add command interface
   - Update state machine to handle new command
   - Add command processing in chat.py

4. **Step 4**: Testing (see Testing Strategy below)

5. **Step 5**: Documentation updates (see Documentation Updates below)

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test NewClass initialization and methods
- Test process_data() with various inputs
- Test edge cases and error handling

#### Integration Tests
- Test command integration with state machine
- Test workflow integration
- Test file operations with temp directories

#### End-to-End Tests
- **E2E Test 1**: Complete user flow from design Use Case 1
- **E2E Test 2**: Error handling flow
- **E2E Test 3**: Edge case workflow

#### Testability Considerations
- Ensure API-level testing (avoid terminal I/O simulation)
- Use temp_file_locations fixture for file operations
- Mock external dependencies (ArXiv API, etc.)

### Risk Areas

- **Risk 1**: Performance concern with large datasets
  - Mitigation: Add benchmarks, optimize if needed

- **Risk 2**: Backward compatibility with existing command X
  - Mitigation: Maintain old behavior, add feature flag if needed

- **Risk 3**: State machine complexity increased
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive state transition tests

### Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Add new command to Command Reference section
- **CLAUDE.md**: Update architecture if new component added
- **devlog.md**: Add entry with implementation summary and original user prompt

## Implementation

_This section is added by design-implementer during Phase 5, after implementation is complete. It replaces the "Implementation Plan" section above._

### Summary

Brief description of how the feature was actually implemented, following the plan above.

### Key Implementation Decisions

- **Decision 1**: Chose approach X over Y because...
- **Decision 2**: Added helper function Z for better testability
- **Decision 3**: Modified existing function W to support new feature

### Deviations from Plan

- Changed step 2 to use different approach because...
- Added extra validation that wasn't in original plan
- (Or: "No significant deviations from plan")

### Test Coverage

- **Unit tests**: 8 tests covering all new functions and edge cases
- **Integration tests**: 4 tests for state machine and workflow integration
- **End-to-end tests**: 3 tests covering complete user workflows
- **Total**: 15 new tests, all passing

### Files Modified/Created

- Created: `src/new_module.py` (150 lines)
- Modified: `src/existing_module.py` (+80 lines)
- Created: `tests/test_new_module.py` (200 lines, 8 tests)
- Modified: `tests/test_existing.py` (+100 lines, 7 tests)

### Known Limitations / TODOs

- [ ] Performance optimization for very large datasets (future work)
- [ ] Additional error messages for edge case X
- (Or: "No known limitations")

### Documentation Updated

- ✓ README.md - Added command reference
- ✓ CLAUDE.md - Updated architecture overview
- ✓ devlog.md - Added implementation entry
- ✓ tests/TESTING_SUMMARY.md - Documented new tests

### Status

Status: ✅ Implemented and tested - ready for use

All tests passing (total: X tests in suite)
